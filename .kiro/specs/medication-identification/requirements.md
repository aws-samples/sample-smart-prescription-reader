# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Medication Identification feature enhances the Smart Prescription Reader by providing accurate identification and matching of medication names in prescription images. This feature will improve the accuracy of prescription transcription by leveraging a comprehensive drug database to identify and correct medication names, even when they contain OCR errors or misspellings. The system will use fuzzy matching algorithms to identify potential medication names and provide detailed information about these medications to the extraction model, enabling more accurate prescription processing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Drug Information Repository

**User Story:** As a pharmacist, I want the system to access a comprehensive drug database, so that it can accurately identify medications even when names are misspelled or partially recognized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes a prescription image THEN it SHALL access a drug information repository to retrieve medication details.
2. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL download and cache the drug database from a configurable S3 location.
3. WHEN the system queries the drug database THEN it SHALL return medication details including drug name, active ingredient, strength, and form.
4. WHEN the system encounters a database access error THEN it SHALL log the error and gracefully degrade functionality.
5. WHEN the system retrieves medication information THEN it SHALL limit the result size to a configurable threshold (default 100KB) to prevent memory issues.

### Requirement 2: Medication Name Identification

**User Story:** As a pharmacist, I want the system to identify potential medication names in OCR text, so that it can provide context for accurate prescription extraction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes OCR text THEN it SHALL identify words that could be medication names.
2. WHEN the system identifies potential medication names THEN it SHALL use fuzzy matching to find similar names in the drug database.
3. WHEN the system performs fuzzy matching THEN it SHALL use a configurable similarity threshold (default 70%).
4. WHEN the system identifies multiple potential matches THEN it SHALL return all matches above the threshold.
5. WHEN the system finds no matches THEN it SHALL continue processing without medication context.

### Requirement 3: Medication Context Generation

**User Story:** As a pharmacist, I want the system to generate medication context for the extraction model, so that it can correct transcription errors and improve accuracy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system identifies medications THEN it SHALL generate a formatted context string with medication details.
2. WHEN the system generates medication context THEN it SHALL include drug name, active ingredient, strength, and form information.
3. WHEN the system provides medication context to the extraction model THEN it SHALL format the information in a way that helps the model correct transcription errors.
4. WHEN the system generates medication context THEN it SHALL limit the context size to prevent exceeding model token limits.
5. WHEN the system generates medication context THEN it SHALL prioritize the most relevant medication information.

### Requirement 4: Integration with Extraction Process

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the medication identification feature to integrate seamlessly with the existing extraction process, so that it enhances accuracy without disrupting the workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes a prescription THEN it SHALL perform medication identification before the extraction step.
2. WHEN the system performs extraction THEN it SHALL include medication context in the extraction prompt.
3. WHEN the system configuration is updated THEN it SHALL allow enabling or disabling the medication identification feature.
4. WHEN the medication identification feature is disabled THEN the system SHALL continue to function without medication context.
5. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL maintain the same API contract for the extraction process.

### Requirement 5: Performance and Resource Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the medication identification feature to be performant and resource-efficient, so that it can be effectively integrated into the prescription processing pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL download and cache the SQLite database file to minimize repeated downloads.
2. WHEN the system performs fuzzy matching THEN it SHALL use efficient algorithms with appropriate caching to minimize processing time.
3. WHEN the system retrieves medication information THEN it SHALL implement adaptive filtering to limit result size.
4. WHEN the system processes medication data THEN it SHALL implement memory-efficient data structures.
5. WHEN the system performs SQLite operations THEN it SHALL properly close connections to prevent resource leaks.
